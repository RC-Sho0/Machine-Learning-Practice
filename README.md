# Machine-Learning-Practice
All the assignments I did at HUFLIT in Machine Learning


## Machine Learning Practice at HUFLIT
**In section 6 at my university 🇻🇳, I was learned Machine Learning 🤖. So here, I gonna show for you my doc. Hope you guys can refer that 🙆🏻**

👇 Tree file:
```
- 🌱 [root] 
   - 📂 __Lab1 + Lab2__
     - 📄 [ Lab2.ipynb]
     - 📄 [Lab1.ipynb]
     - 📂 __mobile\_price\_dataset__
       - 📄 [test.csv]
       - 📄 [train.csv]
   - 📂 __Lab3\_DeepLearning__
     - 📄 [Lab3.ipynb]
     - 📂 __log__
       - 📄 [Brain\_tumor\_2\_log.json]
       - 📄 [Brain\_tumor\_log.json]
   - 📄 [Fullsrc.pdf]
   - 📄 [HMM\-Demo.ipynb]
   - 📄 [keras\-digits\-MLP.ipynb]
   - 📄 [live\-ex\-1.ipynb]
   - 📄 [mini\-test]
```

**In my case have 2 Lab exercise are Lab1+Lab2, Lab3 and some mini task**

1. Lab1+Lab2: My analyze about Mobile Price Dataset.
2. Lab3: My DeepLearning model to solve Brain Tumor Dataset.
3. Mini tasks
4. Fullsrc.pdf: Is my course summary report.
